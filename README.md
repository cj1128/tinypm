## Intro

this project is heavily inspired by the awesome post: [Let's Dev: A Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/07/11/lets-dev-a-package-manager/) but reimplement it from scratch.

It has a clean code base, add some tests and remove `babel-node` requirement compared to original implementation.

## Usage

just type `tinypm` and you are done ðŸ˜Ž.

## Implementation

the whole process is divided into 3 steps implemented in corresponding js files.

1. resolve: read package.json and resolve the whole dependency tree
2. optimize: optimize the dependency tree, try to flat it as much as we can
3. link: download packages and link them to node_modules folder

to speed up the processing, `tinypm` uses `/tmp/.tinypm` as cache dir.

## Notes

as the original implementation, **the binary installation directory is wrong**. 

e.g. if package `A` depends on package `B` which has a binary called `cli-b`, `tinypm` will install `cli-b` to `root/node_modules/.bin/cli-b`, but the correct location is `root/node_modules/A/node_modules/.bin/cli-b`.
